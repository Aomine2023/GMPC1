                                    <p>The Ghana Armed Forces established the National College of Defence Studies (NCDS)
                                        in March 2023 to offer Strategic Courses for senior military officers of the rank of
                                        colonels or equivalent and relevant national agencies of the same status. This is
                                        based on the directive of the President of the Republic of Ghana, pursuant to
                                        section
                                        29(1) of the Education Regulatory Bodies Act 2020 (Act 1023). <br>
                                        The College is a Tri-Service Institution that imparts skills in strategic
                                        leadership, contemporary management thought, concepts and practices, that lead to
                                        effective decision-making, enlightened leadership and efficient resource management
                                        in a knowledge-centric environment to the senior leadership of the Armed Forces and
                                        relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) as well as international
                                        participants at the Conceptual, Directional and Functional levels.<br>
                                        For a long time, the Ghana Armed Forces relied on Foreign Defence and War Colleges
                                        to train its strategic level officers. Due to the limited slots offered by these
                                        foreign nations and tight budgetary allocations, only a few officers get the
                                        opportunity to attend these all-important courses to help them acquire a
                                        high-quality
                                        professional military education at the strategic level. <br>
                                        The establishment of the NCDS has enabled GAF and Ghana as a whole to harness its
                                        full benefits of providing the best environment to produce a good number of
                                        strategic leaders from Ghana and allied countries, capable of marshalling the
                                        instrument of national power to meet the security and other developmental needs of
                                        their countries. It equips strategic leaders with the requisite knowledge and skills
                                        to take up high level policy, leadership and staff positions in any environment.
